This is a proof of concept to make a job queue available on the network
for the Handbrake transcoding front end (http://handbrake.fr/).

The Goal
* A Server is start with file.queue generated by Handbrake.

* A Client with HandbrakeCLI installed connects to the server

* The Server Transfers the unencoded files to the Client 
  ( Only practical over gigabit )

* The Server marks the job as checked out

* The client runs the job it checked out at described in the 
  queuefile on the server

* When the client completes it connects to the server and transfers 
  the encoded output of HandbrakeCLI

* The server marks the job completed

* The client cleans up the raw files transfered for the job

* The client checks the server for another job

* The server delegates unchecked out jobs as long as possible

* The server will then delegate the "checked out" but not "completed" jobs
  as the server sees fit until all jobs are marked "completed"

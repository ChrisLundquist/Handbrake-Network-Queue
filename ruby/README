IMPORTANT: There is a known bug in ruby 1.9.2p0 (2010-08-18 revision 29036) [x86_64-linux]
with the Socket code used in this application. Either of the following are known to work

ruby 1.8.7 (2010-06-23 patchlevel 299) [x86_64-linux]
ruby 1.9.2p94 (2010-12-08 revision 30140) [x86_64-linux]

== Windows ==
Ruby 1.9.1
I have experienced extremely slow TCPSocket.write speeds when running the server
on Windows 7 ( others untested but suspected to be the same ). I am currently
investigating this issue but believe it to be in the implementation interface
between Ruby, C and the Windows API. A problem I am ill equipped to deal with.
